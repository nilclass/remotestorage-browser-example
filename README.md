# Known bugs

* you seem to have to refresh the page to see real-time updates from, say, My Favorite Drinks
* folders are shown twice or three times on the left - maybe related to overlapping sync attempts?
* binary data is not supported
* it only works for private data in <code>/:module/</code>, not for public data in <code>/public/:module/</code>.
* app icon and favicon are missing
